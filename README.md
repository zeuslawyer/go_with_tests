# GO SETUP

-   GOPATH has two segments.

    -   The first is `$PROJ/golang` which stores all downloaded third party libs
    -   The second is `$PROJ/goworkspace` which has all my go projects under `/src`

-   `$PROJ/goworkspace/src` follows the usual repository mirroring convention of `/src/github.com/zeuslawyer/<repo name>`

# `PROJECT LOCATION`

`$PROJ/goworkspace/src/github.com/zeuslawyer/go_with_tests` . This should be `$PWD`
